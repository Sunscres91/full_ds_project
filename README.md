The Repository consits of 3 Notebooks analyzing a Kaggle Housing Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). 

The First Notebook attemps to help with the visualization and slicing of the the Data throught Interative Widgets and Plots in order to better understand the Relationship and Distribution of the Variables.

The Second one imputes the missing values and transforms the features into 3 distinct Datasets ready to be used in the modeling step.

The Third Notebook explores different Models and Hyperparameters as well as the importance of different features for predicting the target Variable.
